"""
The Oak Leaf — a massing model of the house proposed for Sulphur Mountain, at real size.

  Three leaves on the knoll, laid out to the owner's own markup of the site. A tall central leaf
  for the great room, its tip south over the drive where you arrive and its base opening north; a
  leaf north-east for the kitchen and dining — the right-back corner; and a leaf south-east for the
  private lounge, set out under the oaks. The heart is the river-stone chimney of the house that
  stands here now — the great room is built around it, so the model's origin IS that chimney, and
  everything is measured from it.

  Levels, in metres above the main floor (which sits at 425.9 m, the top of the knoll):
    -3.3  the lower floor: three suites cut into the south bank, each with a door onto the court
    -3.5  the parking court, dug from the bank down to the drive
     0    the main floor: foyer, great room, kitchen and dining, lounge, the north terrace
     3.7  the loft over the north half of the great room: the master suite, open to below
     9.8  the ridge of the central leaf; the wings peak at 7.0

  The outdoor rooms are the owner's five marked zones, and they are kept as OUTDOOR rooms: the
  pool and deck back-left (north-west), the outdoor fire back-centre, the oak lounge south-east
  under the standing oaks, the sacred gardens as a corridor along the east. None of them is
  allowed to become building mass — that was the correction that made the composition read as a
  house on a piece of land rather than a resort consuming it.

  Every distance here is provisional until the owner's boundary arrives as real coordinates; the
  massing is sized to sit inside the drawn envelope with room to spare rather than to fill it.

  Nothing here is a finished design. It is the shape at the right size on the right ground, so it
  can be walked around and argued with before anyone draws a wall for real.
